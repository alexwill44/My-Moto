# My-Moto
Ride and repair your own motorcycle, do you have what it takes to keep it on the road?

The rules are simple:
You are the rider, repair your bike on the go, keep the tank full, and the tires fresh.

Click the oil change button with your mouse in order to keep the black oil indicator from running out.

Click the refuel button to keep the green fuel gauge from running out leaving you stranded.

Click the fresh tires button to keep the blue tire life gauge from reaching zero and causing your tires to pop.

If you can keep up with your motorcycles needs you might just make it to the finish.

** be fair warned the nicer the bike the more attention it requires!

##== I used two different css templates Skeleton CSS and NES CSS.
Skeleton because I really liked the grid layout of boot strap but really didn't need all the additional functionality. Skeleton css is a similar layout but a much more barebones layout that makes for a smaller file that quicker to load.
I also used NES css because it matched my desired aesthetic.

##== I also used jQuery.
I really like jQuery compared to vanilla javaScript. The DOM communications are so streamlined it made it very easy to swap elements and add event listeners.

##== My approach.
The approach I took was pretty straight forward I had a lot of fun playing with visuals but really I just wanted this project to be a proof of concept that would let me play with some skills I'm trying to develop.

I really just focused on one page that could feel like it was progressing a narrative using a series of changing background and of pop-up notifications.

##== Unsolved problems.
My first unsolved problem is if you can spam fast enough there is no cap to the value for the gauges - my quick fix was make the values so large and depreciate so quick that it was not really possible to get that far about the indicated max.

My only other unsolved problem was the start timer functionality includes the populate name logic so every-time you level up there is a console.error, but everything runs fine -> I think this could be easily fixed with an IF function but I ran out of time.
